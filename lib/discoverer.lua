--[[
SERVICE_FOUND is a callback that is executed whenever a new service is discovered. Arguments: ip, port, device id, service name, and dict with description and superclass.
SERVICE_LOST is a callback that is executed whenever a service that was once discovered is no longer available. Arguments are the same as SERVICE_FOUND.
TIMEOUT is the the duration that a service should last when no advertisements are heard. If no advertisements are heard for a discovered service for this duration, the service will be removed from the discovered_services table and the SERVICE_LOST callback will be fired.
DPORT is the port where we listen for advertisements (defaults to 1525). IPORT is the port to which we send service invocations (defaults to 1526).
